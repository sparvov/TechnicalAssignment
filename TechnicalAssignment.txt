Please provide solution for the tasks below. Share you code on github or send project. 3th task does not require coding, just describe the solution. Do not spend more than 3 hours.

1. Puzzle
Java class has three int fields which may be changed in the limited range:
int a; // may change from a1 to a2
int b; // may change from b1 to b2
int c; // may change from c1 to c2
where a1, a2, ... are some constants. Implement hashCode method for this class without collisions (assuming that the product of ranges does not exceed Integer.MAX_VALUE).

2. Refactoring
Refactor the code fix error, make sure code complies with Java coding standards. Send refactored code and add comments in code explaining each change.
File – User.java

3. Architecture
Our application has to pass integration tests. Data source for these tests is located on the external test environment.
However, this external test environment allows to run integration test suite against it one at a time.
If several instances are executed against it, test environment crashes and tests will fail randomly.
Please suggest possible solutions how to ensure integration tests will always pass. Describe pros and cons of these solutions.
