The right solution can be made only if root cause of issue with integration tests/environments is found.
So, the first step is to investigate and find the root cause of the problem.

It can be as following:

1. The test environment is not stateless. It means, that different tests from different applications affect each other.
In such a case the solution can be to make the test environments stateless, to separate every test flow from each other.

2. The test environment falls due to its load capacity is not enough.
The solution may be with using a scalability mechanism including a load balancer. This solution can be very expensive
for testing purpose, but anyway, in some cases it can be considered.
The second approach is to redesign integration test cases to exclude such tests that can be done with unit tests.
It can reduce the number of integration tests and overall test environment load.

3. Some tests or test environmental flow are designed with mistakes such as incorrect transaction mechanism
or some other cases which can result unstable behaviour of test ecosystem. This scenario is related to the first paragraph,
so solution is finding and fixing such issues.
